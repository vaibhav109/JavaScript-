        <h2>console.log()</h2>
        <p>It is mainly used to print the output to the console.
            We csn put any type inside the log(), be it a string,
            array, object, boolean etc.
        </p>
    </br>
        <h2>console.error()</h2>
        <p> It is used to log error message to the console. Useful 
            in testing of code. By default the error message will 
            be highlighted with red color.</p>
        </br>
        <h2>console.warn()</h2>
        <p> It is used to log warning message to the console.

        <h2>console.clear()</h2>
        <p> It is used to clear the console. The console will be
            cleared, in case of Chrome a simple overlayed text 
            will be printed like : ‘Console was cleared’. </p>
        </br>
        <h2>console.time() and console.timeEnd()</h2>
        <p> Whenever we want to know the amount of time spend by 
            a block or a function, we can make use of the time() 
            and timeEnd() methods provided by the javascript console
            object. They take a label which must be same, and the 
            code inside can be anything( function, object, simple console).</p>
        </br>
        <h2>console.table()</h2>
        <p> This method allows us to generate a table inside a console.
            The input must be an array or an object which will be shown
            as a table.</p>
        </br>
        <h2>console.count()</h2>
        <p> This method is used to count the number that the function 
            hit by this counting method.</p>
        </br>
        <h2>console.group() and console.groupEnd()</h2>
        <p> group() and groupEnd() methods of the console object allows us
            to group contents in a separate block, which will be indented. 
            Just like the time() and the timeEnd() they also accepts label, 
            again of same value.</p>
        </br>
        <h2>custom console logs</h2>
        <p> User can add Styling to the console logs in order to make logs Custom. 
            The Syntax for it is to add the css styling as a parameter to the 
            logs which will replace %c in the logs</p>
