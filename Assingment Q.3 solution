        <h2>Javascript has 7 datatypes</h2>
        <p>
            Number : A number data type can be an integer, a floating point value, an exponential value, a ‘NaN’ or a ‘Infinity’.</br>

            String : The string data type in JavaScript can be any group of characters enclosed by a single or double-quotes or by brackets.</br>


            Boolean : The boolean data type has only two values, true and false. It is mostly used to check a logical condition. Thus Booleans are logical data types which can be used for comparison of two variables or to check a condition. The true and false implies a ‘yes’ for ‘true’ and a ‘no’ for ‘false in some places when we check a condition or the existence of a variable or a value.</br>

            Undefined : Undefined data type means a variable that is not defined. The variable is declared but doesn’t contain any value.</br>

            Null : The null in JavaScript is a data type that is represented by only one value, the ‘null’ itself. A null value means no value.</br>
            
            Object : An object in JavaScript contains key-value pairs in its address.</br>

            Symbol : The symbol data type defines a property of an object which is private to the object. It refers to the ‘key’ of the key-value pair of an object.</br>
